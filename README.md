# ðŸ¤– Agentic AI: Task-Oriented LLM Agent with Tools & Memory

This project implements a **Task-Oriented Agentic AI System** as part of the KDD LAB Agentic AI Internship Task. Built using LangChain and a local LLM (via Ollama), the agent can reason through tasks using integrated tools and short/long-term memory. A Streamlit-based interface is also included for interactive chat.
